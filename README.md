### Background:
Our project is a software vulnerability visualizer and tracker designed to transform the way users interact with the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) website. With this tool, users can explore vulnerabilities from the NVD website in an insightful and user-friendly manner, gaining valuable insights into potential security risks. Additionally, our platform empowers users to curate their own personalized list of vulnerabilities, allowing them to stay informed and take proactive measures to address potential threats. This project represents a significant step forward in enhancing cybersecurity awareness and preparedness, ultimately contributing to a safer digital environment.
